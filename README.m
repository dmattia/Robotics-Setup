Scripts to complete the "Turtlebot Setup and Getting Started" packet

TO RUN:
    The first time you run this file, you must run 'chmod u+x ./setup.sh' and 'chmod u+x ./setup_tmux.sh' to get the correct permissions
    Run the command '. ./setup.sh'. This first dot is very important!
    If you are prompted for a password, user the password you use to login to the laptop, not your netid password.
    Run the command '.setup_tmux.sh'
