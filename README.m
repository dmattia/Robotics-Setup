Scripts to complete the "Turtlebot Setup and Getting Started" packet

TO RUN:
    change into the root directory of this folder with 'cd Robotics-Setup'
    The first time you run this file, you must run 'chmod u+x ./setup.sh ./setup_tmux.sh' to get the correct permissions
    Turn your robot on
    Run the command '. ./setup.sh'. This first dot is very important!
    If you are prompted for a password, user the password you use to login to the laptop, not your netid password.
    Run the command './setup_tmux.sh'

    That's it! If you are new to tmux, you can switch between panes in the terminal with your mouse. To close a terminal, use C-c to kill any process that is still running and then click C-b then x then y when it asks for confirmation. Make sure to close out of the last pane.
